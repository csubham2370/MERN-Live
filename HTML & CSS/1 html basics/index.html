<body>
    <H1>This is a heading</H1>
    <P>This is a paragraph.</P>
    <DIV>This is a division.</DIV>
    <span>This is a span element.</span>
    <Span>This is another span element with different case.</Span>

    <!--
    HTML is case-insensitive, meaning that tags are recognized regardless of their case (e.g., <DIV> and <div> are treated the same).
    However, it is best practice to use lowercase for HTML tags to maintain consistency and readability in the code.
